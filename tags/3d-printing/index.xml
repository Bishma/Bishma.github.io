&lt;p>I have a humidity problem when it comes to 3D Printing filament. For much of the year it only takes a few days of exposure to the air before even something as forgiving as PLA will start to pop and sputter due to absorbed moisture. Moving spools in and out of dry storage is a pain and my work-horse filaments still ended up spending a lot of time out in the air. A drybox that could feed my 3 most commonly used filaments would help keep these spools printing cleanly, save me time, and cut down the number of times I have to open up my dry storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since there&amp;rsquo;s been this pesky pandemic on (and because one of the reasons I got a printer was to be able to make (re)use of junk around the house), I had a goal to buy as little as possible for this project. After picking through things here are some basics I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;dl>
&lt;dt>&lt;strong>The Box&lt;/strong>&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Gasket boxes are a common sight around our house, so we rearranged some things to free up one that was a good size. This one would support 4 1kg spools, were it not for the bearing assemblies which brings the total down to 3.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>&lt;strong>Spindle / Rod&lt;/strong>&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>A last minute (Zoom) Halloween costume contest left me with a poorly painted 3/4" wooden dowel lying around.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>&lt;strong>Hygrometer&lt;/strong>&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>I had a cheap one from ali-express that was not in use.
&lt;dt>&lt;strong>Rod Holder and Silica Box&lt;/strong>&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Printed&lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl>
&lt;p>In the end I just had to buy some ptfe push fittings. With the starting point defined I got to the fun part:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem-solving">Problem Solving&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Finding a reenforced 3/4&amp;quot; (19mm) dowel holder that would work for a polypropylene box&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> was harder than I thought it would be. I wanted one that would be supported from the outside of the storage box. This was also complicated by it not being easy to search for fractions on Thingiverse.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="solution-1">Solution 1&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This was and easy ask, so I made my own. I used Fusion 360 to create a sweep that was just over 180° so that dowel is loosely held in place when I&amp;rsquo;m moving the box around.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To make assembly easier I &lt;a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-insert-a-standard-part-into-a-Fusion-360-design.html">inserted a hex nut from McMaster-Carr&lt;/a> and use that to cut out a recess in the backing piece. That way the nuts spin less when trying to tighten them.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So much friction! I knew the filament spools wouldn&amp;rsquo;t roll smoothly on a narrow rod, but this was enough friction to make my extruder skip steps. Using a wooden rod was certainly exacerbating the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="solution-2-bearing-assembly">Solution 2: Bearing Assembly&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I could have sufficiently overcome both sources of friction by making a bushing to adapt the average size of a filament spool to my small diameter rod. But I happen to have almost 50 (mediocre quality) 608 bearings that would DEFINITELY do the job&amp;hellip; perhaps too well (thay may spin too freely).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first attempt (left side of the video below) didn&amp;rsquo;t leave enough clearance so it didn&amp;rsquo;t spin well and was going to wear grooves in my wooden dowel. On the right spool in the video you can see how adding just 0.15mm of tolerance got it dialed in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This build warranted it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://dereksrose.com/posts/spool-bearing-assembly/">own post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Space is limited and this dry box is rather large. In the interests of keeping filament paths and friction to a minimum, I wanted the box to sit on top of my Lack Enclosure. But the box is big enough that it would block the slot where I have filament enter my enclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It so happens that my printer enclosure sits in front of an old stove mantle. That leaves me about 15cm of space between the back of the enclosure and the wall. The mantle itself is about 30cm lower than the enclosure&amp;rsquo;s top. So I just needed to give the back end of my box some support and I could make use of those 15cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="solution-3-sterilite-box-stands">Solution 3: Sterilite Box Stands&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I have few options for where this box can sit and the top of my encloser is the only practical spot. I wanted a fast solution that would help stabilize the drybox and keep it from slipping around when the enclosure shakes during fast printhead movements. I also need to be able to move to box readily as my lack enclosure the the kind with the hinged lid. Plus, when your most interesting tool is a 3D printer, every problem looks like a lack of plastic. In this case I wanted something that&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>would print in a single job on my MK3s&lt;/li>
&lt;li>would be stable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>would not use a crazy amount of filament&lt;/li>
&lt;li>is over engineered&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So I decided to design these stand-offs. They have recesses in the top so that the corner of the Sterilite box is locked to the middle of the stand. A dovetailed bar holds the two stands at the correct width to hold the back half of the box.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted this anywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s just so niche.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="problem-4">Problem 4&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I want to keep these 3 spools ready to go without much fuss. That meant feeding the filament from all spools without introducing a place for humidity to creep in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="solution-4">Solution 4&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The folks who feed multi-filament systems (Like an &lt;a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/upgrades/183-original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk25-mk3s.html#">MMU&lt;/a> or a &lt;a href="https://www.mosaicmfg.com/products/palette-3">Pallete&lt;/a>) already have this figured out. I downloaded some &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4853256">drybox filament guides&lt;/a> from thingiverse and used a short length of 1.75mm (ID) PTFE (teflon) tube so there&amp;rsquo;s almost no air space but the filament still goes through with very little friction.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are simpler ways to do this. Don&amp;rsquo;t be like me&amp;hellip; unless you like t kitbash your way to success. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this box for about 6 months now, and other than needing a way to stop the hygrometer from sliding around&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the outcome.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Polypropylene doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to stick to much of anything so supporting the wight of the spools meant screws.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853257">Skadis Universal Hook Set&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have several &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/raskog-utility-cart-white-20382932/">Ikea Raskog carts&lt;/a> at our house including one I use as an end table. They&amp;rsquo;re very versatile but also not easy to keep organized. So this project has been on my todo list longer than I&amp;rsquo;ve had a 3D printer. In fact it was one of the ideas that convinced me to buy a printer in the first place. It was also the second thing I tried to design (the first was a &lt;a href="https://dereksrose.com/posts/garage-lock-handle/">door knob&lt;/a>) and so my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Derek_Prints/status/1271936399005020160">initial attempts&lt;/a> weren&amp;rsquo;t great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I figured out how to make an easily printable hook that would hold firmly onto the cart&amp;rsquo;s trays it was obvious that I could make work the same way that the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853257">Skadis Universal Hook Set&lt;/a> works. Like that collection this is easy to print (no supports), easy to assemble with no glue, strong, and stable. By spacing my hook posts at intervals of 44.5mm I was also able to make the Switch Holder, USB Cable Holder, Pen Holders, and Hook Row compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/skadis-series-37813/">Ikea Skadis pegboard&lt;/a> by swapping the Universal Hook from that set.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I got as far as functional prototypes before I got distracted by other projects. Being one of my first designs in Fusion 360 what I had created was not easy to modify. Then, in the winter of &amp;lsquo;21, PrusaPrinters ran a &lt;a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/organization-contest-announcement_42886/">contest&lt;/a> for organizer designs which spurred me to finish things up. I recreated my designs in a more maintainable way and got them to a releasable state before the contest ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s included.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="one-piece-hooks">One Piece Hooks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On work carts it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to hang tools off the size. I ended up making a couple sizes as a design compromise. The &amp;ldquo;narrow&amp;rdquo; version is 4mm square and plenty strong (especially when printed with 3 perimeters)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you do a lot of 3D printing you use a lot of super glue (AKA CyanoAcrylate, AKA &amp;ldquo;CA&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s a crack fixer, gap filler, layer re-adherer, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1ciPnTGKg">classic movie line&lt;/a>, and I think you can use it to stick things together or something. Moreover different use cases require different formulations, and the bottle you can find is never the one you need (I think it says so on the label).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I decided to design a carrier for all my CA. A &amp;ldquo;CAddy,&amp;rdquo; if you will. And because that sounded kind of boring I decided to design it around a super glue molecule (specifically &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_cyanoacrylate">ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I had this idea a while ago because I was sick of my glue bottles getting separated. The thing that finally got me to finish it up is a &lt;a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/organization-contest-announcement_42886/">contest on prusaprinters.org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="features">Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Because it&amp;rsquo;s not a Derek project if its not over-engineered I&amp;rsquo;ve packed as many features as I could make fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Slots for up to 4 bottles with

>optional labels&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sized for 50g bottles of &lt;a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbyking-super-glue-ca-50g-1-7oz-super-thin.html">Hobby King glues&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Specifically, the ovals that are

data-lightbox="features"

title="Fusion 360 sketch showing the oval dimensions: 50mm x 30mm"
>50mm on the long side and 30mm on the short side&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The oxygen at the 4 position will hold an acupuncture needle (useful for clog clearing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The triple bond holds a
&lt;a
data-lightbox="features"
href="https://dereksrose.com/images/CAddy/knife%20assembly.jpg"
title="Assembly of the utility knife."
>utility knife&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The printed handle holds a #1 utility blade screws together for safety&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The other oxygen atom is big enough for a sharpie or a small rolled up rag / sandpaper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The front has a small slot sized to hold a few craft (popsicle) sticks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The end of the molecule is a textured handle&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="design">Design&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had two starting points. First I wanted it design it around the CA molecular line diagram. I easily found the diagram in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_cyanoacrylate#/media/File:Ethyl_cyanoacrylate.svg">SVG format&lt;/a> on wikipedia. I aligned the bottle cutouts so they point at the carbon junctions and was pleased with the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, I was able to find a step model of a #1 utility knife on
&lt;a href="https://grabcad.com/library/utility-blade-3">grabcad&lt;/a>, size a handle around it, and perform a &lt;a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/getting-started/caas/screencast/Main/Details/1365f377-8bf4-4845-92af-4b775858a9d6.html">boolean subtraction&lt;/a> and have a nice starting point for the utility knife handle. Adding tolerances for FDM was a bit of a challenge and results in the blade having a little bit of play in the handle. But as long as downward pressure is being applied there is a machine screw reenforcing the main stress point. I don&amp;rsquo;t think different dimensional accuracies will affect function or safety. Use your best judgement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When we take our outdoor umbrella down for the season we like to put something over the remaining part of the stand. In years past we made use of an old travel mug, a plastic bag, and some duct tape. This year as we were taking it down Bonnie said, &amp;ldquo;hey, I&amp;rsquo;ll bet you can design and print a cap for that.&amp;rdquo; Spoiler: she was right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This was a straight forward design in Fusion 360. It took so little time I decided to model and print an umbrella to go with it. I still ended up doing it pretty quick, this is far from the most printable thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever designed. Every orientation of the umbrella seemed to result in nasty overhangs, so at the end of the day I just printed it
&lt;a

&lt;p>The pole on our umbrella is
&lt;a
data-lightbox="design"
href="https://dereksrose.com/images/umbrella-stand-cap/sketch.png"
>43.25mm in diameter&lt;/a> with two lock pins that are 9.35mm in diameter and 33..95mm from its top.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The umbrella needs a layer height of 0.15mm and I decided to print both pieces on one place.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Layer Height: 0.15mm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Infill: 20%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supports: Umbrella Only&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Carefully remove the supports from the umbrella without breaking the umbrella pole. If you have any elephant footing you may need to clean up the bottom of the pole before it will insert into the cap. Use a drop of super glue to attach the two.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I decided to go with PETG since it&amp;rsquo;s more UV resistant than PLA. Plus this Prusament Galaxy Black looks fun in

&lt;p>One of the issues I encountered when I decided to try to make a filament dry box out of material I had on hand was that my rod (a 19mm wooden dowel left over from Halloween) was causing too much friction. I knew a heavy spool on a narrow rod would slide rather than roll, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate just how much force would be required to feed filament. My printer was not happy and my prints were full of under-extrusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did a little research and figured out that a bushing would solve my issue (effectively adapting the 19mm rod to make it a ~50mm rod) buuuuut&amp;hellip; I also have a ton of crappy 608 bearings that I got for cheap. Plus, you know, bearings are more fun than bushings. &lt;span class="emoticon">¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured three points of contact would be sufficient for the weight, but three 608 bearing + the diameter of the dowel is greater than the 50mm inner diameter of a filament spool. That means that the end caps are as thick as a 608 bearing + the plastic to hold them in place. I pressed ahead anyway knowing this extra width means I can only fit 3 spools in my dry box instead of 4.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="design">Design&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was pretty straight forward. I looked up the dimensions of a 608 bearing and the average diameter for a 1kg filament spool&amp;rsquo;s hole. In Fusion 360 I used the radius of the bearing and the diameter of the dowel to layout the caps. I used brass inserts for screwing that parts of the caps together. I did so mainly because I has a new soldering iron tip I wanted to try. Should I need more caps in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll probably tweak the design to use M3 hex nuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first prototype technically worked but I forgot to add any tolerance and so there was no play between the assembly and the dowel.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FpKSwWCUTk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It was still better than it was without the assembly, but I was sure the weight of the spools and the tightness of the bearings would result in grooves and/or flat spots wearing on the wooden dowel. For my second attempt I moved the bearings 0.15mm further from the rod. Now, if anything, it might spin too well but decided to use it as is. When the printer feeds the spools inertia can cause it to keep rolling a bit allowing some slack to build up.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how the whole dry box project turned out. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a post about it soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Garage Lock Handle</title><link>https://dereksrose.com/posts/garage-lock-handle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:55:11 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://dereksrose.com/posts/garage-lock-handle/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="thank-you-for-your-service-vice-grips">Thank you for your service, vice-grips&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The reason I wanted to get a 3D printer was to make solutions for common problems so designing my own models was always a goal. I decided a good first project would be to replace our missing interior garage door handle. It was missing when we bought out house and for the first 5 years we lived here we made due using a pair of vice grips to turn the spindle.&lt;/p>
