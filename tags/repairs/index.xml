&lt;p>Our 1950&amp;rsquo;s home has its original garage door track and spring. The whole thing has help up remarkably well but it still is aging as resistant to any repair less than a full restoration. Over almost 70 years the spring that assists door opening and also helps hold the door up has weakened. Since we have plans to rework the garage I&amp;rsquo;m not taking on that project (now) and have been making do with the fact the garage door doesn&amp;rsquo;t always hold itself up anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the last 18 months the fix has been a screwdriver tied near the door with string, that we can insert through a hold an prevent the door from falling. In terms of quick fixes for common life problems, this one isn&amp;rsquo;t bad but it&amp;rsquo;s not without some annoyances. There are only a couple holes in the track and they&amp;rsquo;re relatively convenient for holding the door all the way up. Also the string sometimes gets caught up in the door and fling around the screw driver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made a simple chock out of TPU with a small handle.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I put magnets in the base for two purposes. First, when the door is closed its handy to be able to attach the chock the the door lock assembly. Second, it hold the chock in place against gravity until the force of the wheel pushing the chock against the track lets friction do most of the work.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wedge is deep enough to more than accommodate all the horizontal wheel movement that the door track allows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eight 10mm x 2mm rare earth magnets (4 stacks of 2 magnets) for holding strength.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy printing.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Handle prints separately attaches with a dovetail&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assembles with super glue.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>0.2mm layer height&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10% infill&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 perimeters&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I used TPU that is Shore 40D hardness. I think something a bit softer (but not all the way to Ninjaflex) would have been better. I printed the handle in PETG because it&amp;rsquo;s what I had in the printer at the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made mine with a debossed monogram on the handle. I have also included an STL without it.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>A file or course sandpaper for distressing magnet surfaces (optional)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I made this using 10mmx2mm magnets because it&amp;rsquo;s what I had on hand. Since I needed a bit more &lt;em>uumph&lt;/em> I stacked two magnets into each of the four holes (8 total magnets). With rare earth magnets I always like to use a file to scuff the surfaces of the magnets before I glue them in. I also used thin CA so it&amp;rsquo;s really get into the nooks and crannies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also glued the handle to the ramp. I use rubberized superglue here, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really think it was needed. I put the glue on the ramp: some on the bottom of the dovetail and some on the backstop that keeps the handle from sliding out the front side of the ramp. A little glue goes a long way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When we take our outdoor umbrella down for the season we like to put something over the remaining part of the stand. In years past we made use of an old travel mug, a plastic bag, and some duct tape. This year as we were taking it down Bonnie said, &amp;ldquo;hey, I&amp;rsquo;ll bet you can design and print a cap for that.&amp;rdquo; Spoiler: she was right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This was a straight forward design in Fusion 360. It took so little time I decided to model and print an umbrella to go with it. I still ended up doing it pretty quick, this is far from the most printable thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever designed. Every orientation of the umbrella seemed to result in nasty overhangs, so at the end of the day I just printed it
&lt;a
data-lightbox="design"
href="https://dereksrose.com/images/umbrella-stand-cap/support%20example.jpg"
>with a load of supports&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pole on our umbrella is
&lt;a
data-lightbox="design"
href="https://dereksrose.com/images/umbrella-stand-cap/sketch.png"
>43.25mm in diameter&lt;/a> with two lock pins that are 9.35mm in diameter and 33..95mm from its top.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The umbrella needs a layer height of 0.15mm and I decided to print both pieces on one place.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Layer Height: 0.15mm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Infill: 20%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supports: Umbrella Only&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Carefully remove the supports from the umbrella without breaking the umbrella pole. If you have any elephant footing you may need to clean up the bottom of the pole before it will insert into the cap. Use a drop of super glue to attach the two.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I decided to go with PETG since it&amp;rsquo;s more UV resistant than PLA. Plus this Prusament Galaxy Black looks fun in

&lt;p>The reason I wanted to get a 3D printer was to make solutions for common problems so designing my own models was always a goal. I decided a good first project would be to replace our missing interior garage door handle. It was missing when we bought out house and for the first 5 years we lived here we made due using a pair of vice grips to turn the spindle.&lt;/p>
